Here’s the Problem.',NULL,'Can Nafta be re-engineered to raise workers’ wages?\n\nOrganized labor thinks so. As the United States sets out to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada, union officials are pinning their hopes on President Trump’s nationalist pronouncements, betting he can deliver what President Bill Clinton failed to put on the table nearly a quarter-century ago: real protection against cheap Mexican labor.\n\nFooled once by a labor “side agreement” that Mr. Clinton added to Nafta to gain union approval, but that proved unable to constrain employers’ misdeeds in any significant way, labor is aiming this time for the heart of what it considers unfair competition. It is demanding a guarantee that wages — especially Mexican wages — rise to ensure a “level playing field.”\n\nAmong an extensive set of recommendations presented to the United States trade representative, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. asked that Nafta guarantee that “all workers — regardless of sector — have the right to receive wages sufficient for them to afford, in the region of the signatory country where the worker resides, a decent standard of living for the worker and her or his family.” A decent standard of living, the labor federation specified, includes food, water, housing, education, health care, transportation, clothing and other essential needs, including the ability to save for retirement and emergencies.\n\nExporting a product that involved workers paid less than this living wage, at any point in the production chain, would be an outright violation of Nafta, subject to standard punitive procedures.\n\nMexican workers would undoubtedly appreciate being able to pay for all that stuff. Demanding a wage floor is the kind of straightforward arm-twisting that Mr. Trump might appreciate. Still, using Nafta to protect American jobs by mandating Mexico’s standard of living remains a fairly loopy idea.\n\nContinue reading the main story\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\nU.S. Begins Nafta Negotiations With Harsh Words AUG. 16, 2017\n\nTrump’s Stalled Trade Agenda Leaves Industries in the Lurch AUG. 7, 2017\n\nECONOMIC SCENE\nThe Mirage of a Return to Manufacturing Greatness APRIL 26, 2016\n\nECONOMIC SCENE\nNafta May Have Saved Many Autoworkers’ Jobs MARCH 29, 2016\n\nEconomic Scene\nA column by Eduardo Porter that explores the world’s most urgent economic challenges.\nIt’s the Economy, Democrats, but Inequality Is Not the Issue\nAUG 15\nThe Danger From Low-Skilled Immigrants: Not Having Them\nAUG 8\nThe Tax Reform America Needs (and Probably Won’t Get)\nAUG 1\nTo Punish Putin, Economic Sanctions Are Unlikely to Do the Trick\nJUL 25\nIn Health Care, Republicans Could Learn From Rwanda\nJUL 18\nSee More »\n\n“Stipulating that countries must pay above-market wages when producing export goods for the U.S. feels like outrageous economic imperialism,” said David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Should Germany also impose this rule on the U.S., since our manufacturing workers surely make less than their German counterparts who are working under industry-level labor agreements?”\n\nIt is not the first time organized labor has thought along these lines. In the early ’90s, when Nafta had yet to become law, the union-backed Alliance for Responsible Trade argued that minimum wages in the tradable-goods sectors of all three North American countries should “move as quickly as possible toward that of the highest-wage country” and allow for a decent quality of life.\n\nThis time, though, labor has a better hand. It can afford to be bolder. A quarter of a century ago, unions reluctantly acquiesced to Nafta based on the premise that American workers would get the better end of the deal — new high-skilled, well-paid jobs in a regional supply chain that sent only its low-skill, low-wage bits south of the border.\n\nWhat’s more, the cheap labor they so feared would become more expensive over time. Investment in Mexico by multinationals serving the North American market would naturally lift Mexico’s standards of living to converge with those of its neighbor to the north, turning Mexicans into rich consumers hungry for American-made products.\n\nThis didn’t quite happen. American manufacturing has lost millions of jobs, and typical household incomes have increased by less than half a percent per year. Most troubling for American workers staring into a future in which Nafta is still the name of the game, the wage gap with Mexico has not closed, even with the tepid wage growth in the United States.',12,NULL,0,'2017-08-27 22:22:41'),(2,'http://ew.com/tv/2017/08/22/game-of-thrones-season-7-finale-title/','Game of Thrones season 7 finale title and length revealed',NULL,'Sunday’s super-sized episode is called “The Dragon and the Wolf” (preview below). \n\nThe episode’s buzzed-about running time has also now been officially confirmed: 79 minutes, 43 seconds. \n\n\nThat makes the finale the longest episode in the HBO drama’s history. The second longest, by the way, was this week’s “Beyond the Wall,” which just edged out last year’s finale for the record.\n\nIn the episode, representatives of the Lannister, Targaryen, and Stark houses unite for a pivotal cease-fire meeting at the Dragonpit — an ancient ruin in King’s Landing where the Targaryen rulers once kept their dragons — to discuss the threat of the Night King. Characters at the meeting include Cersei Lannister, Missandei, Jon Snow, Theon Greyjoy, Ser Davos, Tyrion Lannister, Brienne of Tarth, Jaime Lannister, and others (absent from footage of the meeting: Daenerys Targaryen). So the title could refer to the meeting … or potentially Jon and Dany’s burgeoning romance … or both?\n\n\nSpeaking of records, Sunday’s “Beyond the Wall” came close to breaking another benchmark for the network — generating 10.2 million viewers overnight (and more than 14 million when including repeats and streaming). That ties “The Spoils of War” earlier this season as the show’s second most-watched episode. Typically, Game of Thrones finales tend to set ratings records, so we’ll have to see if the show breaks through another ceiling before our long wait for season 8 — which goes into production in October and is expected to premiere in either late 2018 or early 2019.',13,NULL,0,'2017-08-27 22:22:41'),(3,'https://venturebeat.com/2017/06/30/indie-dev-turns-wikipedia-into-a-text-adventure-game/','Indie dev turns Wikipedia into a text adventure game',NULL,'Like a lot of people, I’ve spent hours clicking from link to link, sucked into Wikipedia’s endless void of information. Indie dev Kevan Davis apparently has as well — except he came out on the other side with a game. Wikipedia: The Text Adventure is a free-to-play piece of interactive fiction that uses real entries to create a virtual world to explore.\n\nThere are already a few informal Wikipedia challenges floating around out there, such as Wikirace. It also goes by The Wiki Game, WikiLadders, or the cheekiest name yet, Wikispeedia, and you play it just by applying certain rules to Wikipedia pages. A page serves as “home base.” Players then start on a random page and try to reach home base by leapfrogging from one page to the next. The person who reaches it in the fewest clicks or fastest time wins.\n\nDavis’s game is different — a slow, contemplative, curated travel guide to what at first appears to be a truly lonely planet. It expands on some of the experiments and themes in one of his previous works, Around the World in X Wikipedia Articles, a 117,000-word novel based on Around the World in 80 Days and generated with excerpts from Wikipedia using software.\n\n“At the time I experimented with autogenerating a standalone text adventure along the same lines, but even a single small city quickly ballooned into enough articles to overload the compiler,” said Davis in an email, comparing the two works. “Today’s game generates itself piece by piece, instead, as the player moves around.”\n\nIn my first playthrough, I felt an almost off-putting sense of distance to the descriptions of places. The start screen offered me a few different options for where my trip could begin. When I clicked on Austria, I got a dry description of its famous ferris wheel, a recitation of facts such as its height (it’s 64.75 meters tall) and its exact location (Leopoldstadt, the second district in Vienna). I then had a few options to go to different locations, each as plainly described as the last.\n\nIt didn’t feel like the kind of experience that tries to make itself approachable or comfortable; instead, each location I visited felt cold and alien. But on the second playthrough, I noticed that there was a terminal prompt at the bottom and realized I could interact with it beyond just shuffling from city to city.\n\nOn Easter Island, I typed: “Examine statues.” The game responded with more information — still generated from Wikipedia, still dry — but it was something.',14,NULL,0,'2017-08-27 22:22:41'),(4,'https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/full-text-attorney-general-jeff-sessions-opening-remarks-senate-intelligence-n771786','Full Text of Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ Opening Remarks to Senate Intelligence Committee',NULL,'The opening statement of Attorney General Jeff Sessions to the Senate Intelligence Committee, as prepared for delivery:\n\nThank you Chairman [Richard] Burr and Ranking Member [Mark] Warner for allowing me to publicly appear before the committee today.\n\nI appreciate the Committee’s critically important efforts to investigate Russian interference with our democratic process. Such interference can never be tolerated and I encourage every effort to get to the bottom of any such allegations.\n\n Sessions Details Reasons for His Recusal from Russia Investigation Play Facebook Twitter Embed\n Sessions Details Reasons for His Recusal from Russia Investigation 3:12\nAs you know, the Deputy Attorney General [Rod Rosenstein] has appointed a special counsel to investigate matters related to Russian interference in the 2016 election. I am here today to address several issues that have been specifically raised before this committee, and I appreciate the opportunity to respond to questions as fully as I am able to do so. But as I advised you, Mr. Chairman, and consistent with long-standing Department of Justice practice, I cannot and will not violate my duty to protect confidential communications with the President.\n\nNow, let me address some issues directly: I did not have any private meetings nor do I recall any conversations with any Russian officials at the Mayflower Hotel. I did not attend any meetings at that event. Prior to the speech, I attended a reception with my staff that included at least two dozen people and President Trump. Though I do recall several conversations I had during that pre-speech reception, I do not have any recollection of meeting or talking to the Russian Ambassador or any other Russian officials. If any brief interaction occurred in passing with the Russian Ambassador during that reception, I do not remember it. After the speech, I was interviewed by the news media, which had gathered as I remember in a different room, and then I left the hotel.\n\nRelated: Sessions: \'Appalling and Detestable Lie\' to Accuse Him of Collusion\n\nBut whether I ever attended a reception where the Russian Ambassador was also present is entirely beside the point of this investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 campaigns. Let me state this clearly: I have never met with or had any conversations with any Russians or any foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election. Further, I have no knowledge of any such conversations by anyone connected to the Trump campaign. I was your colleague in this body for 20 years, and the suggestion that I participated in any collusion or that I was aware of any collusion with the Russian government to hurt this country, which I have served with honor for over 35 years, or to undermine the integrity of our democratic process, is an appalling and detestable lie.\n\nRelatedly, there is the assertion that I did not answer Senator [Al] Franken’s question honestly at my confirmation hearing. That is false. This is how it happened. He asked me a rambling question that included dramatic, new allegations that the United States intelligence community had advised President-elect Trump that “there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump’s surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government.” I was taken aback by these explosive allegations, which he said were being reported in breaking news that day. I wanted to refute immediately any suggestion that I was a part of such an activity. I replied, “Senator Franken, I’m not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn’t have – did not have communications with the Russians, and I’m unable to comment on it.”\n\nThat was the context in which I was asked the question, and in that context, my answer was a fair and correct response to the charge as I understood it. It simply did not occur to me to go further than the context of the question and list any conversations I may have had with Russians in routine situations, as I had with numerous other foreign officials.\n\nImage: Attorney General Jeff Sessions Testifies on Russia Investigation\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions is sworn in to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committe on June 13, 2017. Shawn Thew / EPA\nPlease hear me now. It was only in March of this year that a reporter asked my spokesperson whether I had ever met with any Russian officials. This was the first time that question had been posed. On the same day, we provided that reporter with the information related to the meeting I and my staff had held in my Senate office with Ambassador [Sergey] Kislyak, as well as the brief encounter in July after a speech that I had given during the convention in Cleveland, Ohio. I also provided the reporter a list of all 25 foreign ambassador meetings I had held during 2016. In addition, I provided supplemental testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee to explain this. I readily acknowledged these two meetings. Certainly nothing improper occurred.\n\nRelated: Did Trump, Kushner, Session Have Undisclosed Meeting With Russian?\n\nLet me also explain clearly the circumstances of my recusal from the investigation into the Russian interference with the 2016 election. I was sworn in as Attorney General on Thursday, February 9th. The very next day, I met with career Department officials, including a senior ethics official, to discuss some things publicly reported in the press and that might have some bearing on the issue of recusal. From that point, February 10th, until I announced my formal recusal on March 2nd, I was never briefed on any investigative details and did not access information about the investigation; I received only the limited information that the Department’s career officials determined was necessary to inform my recusal decision. As such, I have no knowledge about this investigation beyond what has been publicly reported, and I have taken no action with regard to any such investigation. On the date of my formal recusal, my Chief of Staff sent an email to the heads of the relevant departments, including by name to Director [James] Comey of the FBI, to instruct them to inform their staffs of this recusal and to advise them not to brief me or involve me in any such matters. And in fact, they have not. Importantly, I recused myself not because of any asserted wrongdoing on my part during the campaign, but because a Department of Justice regulation, 28 CFR 45.2, required it. That regulation states, in effect, that Department employees should not participate in investigations of a campaign if they have served as a campaign advisor.\n\nThe scope of my recusal, however, does not and cannot interfere with my ability to oversee the Department of Justice, including the FBI, which has an $8 billion budget and 35,000 employees. I presented to the President my concerns, and those of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, about the ongoing leadership issues at the FBI as stated in my letter recommending the removal of Mr. Comey along with the Deputy Attorney General’s memorandum, which have been released publicly by the White House. It is a clear statement of my views. It is absurd, frankly, to suggest that a recusal from a single specific investigation would render an Attorney General unable to manage the leadership of the various Department of Justice law enforcement components that conduct thousands of investigations.\n\nRelated: Sessions Met Russian Ambassador but Didn\'t Mislead Senate\n\nFinally, during his testimony, Mr. Comey discussed a conversation he and I had about a meeting Mr. Comey had with the President. I am happy to share with the committee my recollection of the conversation I had with Mr. Comey. Following a routine morning threat briefing, Mr. Comey spoke to me and my Chief of Staff. While he did not provide me with any of the substance of his conversation with the President, Mr. Comey expressed concern about the proper communications protocol with the White House and with the President. I responded to his comment by agreeing that the FBI and Department of Justice needed to be careful to follow Department policies regarding appropriate contacts with the White House. Mr. Comey had served in the Department of Justice for the better part of two decades, and I was confident that Mr. Comey understood and would abide by the Department’s well-established rules governing any communications with the White House about ongoing investigations. My comments encouraged him to do just that and indeed, as I understand, he did. Our Department of Justice rules on proper communication between the Department and the White House have been in place for years. Mr. Comey well knew them, I thought, and assumed correctly that he complied with them.\n\nI will finish with this. I recused myself from any investigation into the campaigns for President, but I did not recuse myself from defending my honor against scurrilous and false allegations. At all times throughout the course of the campaign, the confirmation process, and since becoming Attorney General, I have dedicated myself to the highest standards.\n\nThe people of this country expect an honest and transparent government and that is what we are giving them. This President wants to focus on the people of this country to ensure they are treated fairly and kept safe. The Trump agenda is to improve the lives of the American people. I know some have other agendas, but that is his agenda and it is one I share.\n\nImportantly, as Attorney General I have a responsibility to enforce the laws of this Nation, to protect this country from its enemies, and to ensure the fair administration of justice. I intend to work every day with our fine team and the superb professionals in the Department of Justice to advance the important work we have to do. These false attacks, the innuendo, and the leaks, you can be sure, will not intimidate me. In fact, these events have only strengthened my resolve to fulfill my duty to reduce crime, and to support our federal, state, and local law enforcement officers who work our streets every day. Just last week, it was reported that overdose deaths in this country are rising faster than ever recorded. The murder rate is up over 10 percent—the largest increase since 1968. Together, we are telling the gangs, the cartels, the fraudsters, and the terrorists—we are coming after you. Every one of our citizens, no matter who they are or where they live, has the right to be safe in their homes and communities. And I will not be deterred, and I will not allow this great Department to be deterred from its vital mission.\n\nThank you.

I don’t desert for political reasons. I’ll stick with him.\'\n\n- Former Sheriff Joe Arpaio, on possibility of a pardon from Trump\nBut the White House made clear that no announcement will be made in Phoenix. \n\nEarlier Tuesday, Arpaio told Fox News he wasn’t sure if he’d even be at the rally.\n\n“I haven’t officially been invited—I’ve been to every single one in the last two years, but I don’t anticipate going down there on my own,” Arpaio told Fox News, adding that he was “not sure” if the president would issue a pardon.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately respond to comment on whether they plan to extend an invitation to the sheriff.\n\nTRUMP \'SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING\' A PARDON FOR EX-SHERIFF JOE ARPAIO\n\n“I would accept [a pardon], but we’ll see what happens,” Arpaio said, while stressing that his support for Trump and his administration is unwavering. “[I]t doesn’t matter because I’m still going to support him as long as he is the president of the United States because that’s the way I am. I don’t desert for political reasons. I’ll stick with him.”\n\nArpaio added: “I said he’ll go down in history as one of the best presidents we’ve ever had, and I stick with that prediction regardless.”\n\nArpaio, 85, who served as sheriff in Maricopa County for more than 20 years before losing election in 2016, forged a national reputation for his tough and controversial policies cracking down on illegal immigration. Arpaio’s widely publicized tactics included forcing inmates to wear pink underwear and housing them in desert tent camps.\n\nHe was convicted of misdemeanor contempt of court for disregarding an Arizona judge’s order in 2011 to stop his anti-immigrant traffic patrols. \n\n“We’ve been fighting this and appealing this, but no one will really look at our defense,” Arpaio said, claiming that he did not use “racial profiling” but used race as a “criteria.” He complained he wasn\'t given a jury trial. \n\n“Of course, if I had a jury, I never would have been convicted,” he said. \n\nArpaio is expected to be sentenced Oct. 5, and could face up to six months in prison. \n\n“Is there anyone in local law enforcement who has done more to crack down on illegal immigration than Sheriff Joe?” Trump asked, during the interview with Fox News\' Gregg Jarrett last week. “He has protected people from crimes and saved lives. He doesn’t deserve to be treated this way.”\n\nArpaio, who endorsed then-candidate Trump in January 2016, told Fox News on Tuesday that he had not spoken directly with the president since after the election, but claimed that his attorney wrote “memos” in June to Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\n“I know the president was made aware of the memos. I know all these guys at the White House. I campaigned with a lot of them,” Arpaio said Tuesday morning, though the Justice Department did not comment on-the-record on the matter.\n\nThe White House did not have any comment on whether the president had reviewed the Arpaio memos.\n\nThe prospect of a pardon has touched off a political debate in Arizona. Republican Reps. Andy Biggs and Trent Franks support a pardon, while Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton called for the president to reconsider even hosting Tuesday\'s event.\n\n“Let’s be clear: A pardon of Arpaio can be viewed only as a presidential enfdorsement of the lawlessness and discrimination that terrorized Phoenix’s Latino community,” Stanton wrote in on an op-ed in the Washington Post on Monday.\n\nBefore the rally, Trump will visit U.S. Customs and Border Protection at Yuma Station in Arizona, the main base of operations for the USBP Yuma Sector. The president will meet with Border Patrol agents, and discuss policy initiatives and legislative efforts, like Kate’s Law and the funding of his paramount campaign promise – the wall.\n\nA DHS official told reporters on a conference call Tuesday morning that Border Patrol has apprehended 126,472 people who were illegally attempting to enter the United States at the border between Jan. 1 and July 31 of this year – a 46 percent decrease in the level of apprehensions from the same time last year.\n\nTrump signed an executive order in January calling for a “physical wall along the southern border.” However, a DHS official Tuesday described the southern border infrastructure as both wall and fence. \n\n\"The wall is a prominent part of that, but what is along the border in Yuma is fence, so we use those two interchangeably,\" DHS spokesman Dave Lapan told reporters. \"...

They have an efficiency of around 80%, which is four times the level of commercial solar panels, and more than six times the level of chlorophyll.\n\"We prize these cyborg bacteria and their ability to make acetate because they produce a substrate that we can already use to produce more valuable and more interesting products,\" said Dr Sakimoto.\n\"We have collaborators who have a number of strands of E. coli that are genetically engineered to take acetic acid as their food source and they can upgrade it into butanol and a polymer called polyhydroxybutyrate.\"\nSoaking in the Sun\nDr Sakimoto believes that these bacteria offer some advantages over other approaches to generating green energy from biological sources.\nOther techniques for artificial photosynthesis require expensive solid electrodes.\nThe cyborg bug approach really only needs large vats of liquid to be kept out in the Sun - the bacteria are self-replicating and self-regenerating, making it potentially a low waste technology. It might work best in rural areas or in the developing world.\nThe research work was carried out at the University of California, Berkeley in the lab of Dr Peidong Yang.\n\"The thrust of research in my lab is to essentially \'supercharge\' non-photosynthetic bacteria by providing them energy in the form of electrons from inorganic semiconductors, like cadmium sulphide, that are efficient light absorbers,\" Dr Yang said.\n\"We are now looking for more benign light absorbers than cadmium sulphide to provide bacteria with energy from light.\"\nThe researchers believe that while their approach has taken an important new step, it might not ultimately be the technology that prevails.\n\"There are so many different designs of these systems coming out and really we\'ve only begun to explore the different ways we can combine chemistry and biology,\" said Dr Sakimoto.\n\"And there\'s a real possibility that that there will be some upstart technology that will come out that will do better than our system.\"',18,NULL,0,'2017-08-27 22:22:41'),(8,'http://nba.nbcsports.com/2017/08/22/report-cavaliers-trade-kyrie-irving-to-celtics-for-thomas-crowder-brooklyn-pick/?cid=eref:nbcnews:text','Report: Cavaliers trade Kyrie Irving to Celtics for Thomas, Crowder, Brooklyn pick',NULL,'Amazingly, the Cavaliers and Celtics just traded the No. 1 and No. 60 (dead last) picks in the 2011 NBA draft.\n\nThe sides had discussed this trade in the past but Cleveland demanded Jayson Tatum in the deal, and that was the end of it. Things moved fast now because the Cavaliers came off that demand.\n\nThis is an emotional blow to a lot of Boston fans — they embraced the underdog, undersized Thomas as one of their own. They got back a younger player on a better contract who will age better, but Thomas is still a fan favorite. With good reason.\n\nCleveland did as well as they could have realistically hoped for in an Irving trade — which is why this is a win for them. They get an All-NBA point guard in Isaiah Thomas with numbers similar last season to Irving to put next to LeBron James, and they add a quality wing defender in Jae Crowder who can help them against Boston and Golden State (plus Crowder is on a great contract). Cleveland remains the team to beat in the East and can make another run at the Warriors and a ring, then if LeBron leaves after the season as a free agent the Cavaliers can decide whether to tear it down and rebuild or bring Thomas back (on less than max deal).\n\nBoston may like this deal, but Cleveland remains the team to beat in the East — and they will have a very high pick in the upcoming draft (which is deep with quality bigs).\n\nBoston’s starting five is still very good — Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Marcus Morris, and Al Horford, with Marcus Smart and Jayson Tatum coming off the bench. And they still have the Lakers’ first round pick next year (protected).  Is that good enough to beat Cleveland? Not next season, but if LeBron leaves in 2018 Boston is a team poised to take charge in the East. Danny Ainge and the Celtics have been playing the long game and this fits with that.\n\nBoston can argue they won the trade because they got the best player in Irving — and he is going to look even better in Brad Steven’s system. After next season this can work for Boston. For next season, Boston got a player in Irving who put up marginally better numbers than Thomas, is a marginally better defender, and they gave up a lot of assets to do it. Short term this is a win for Cleveland, and maybe long term depending on the Brooklyn pick.',19,NULL,0,'2017-08-27 22:22:41'),(9,'https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/08/170822092228.htm','Turning human waste into plastic, nutrients could aid long-distance space travel',NULL,'Imagine you\'re on your way to Mars, and you lose a crucial tool during a spacewalk. Not to worry, you\'ll simply re-enter your spacecraft and use some microorganisms to convert your urine and exhaled carbon dioxide (CO2) into chemicals to make a new one. That\'s one of the ultimate goals of scientists who are developing ways to make long space trips feasible.\n\nThe researchers are presenting their results today at the 254th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS).\n\nAstronauts can\'t take a lot of spare parts into space because every extra ounce adds to the cost of fuel needed to escape Earth\'s gravity. \"If astronauts are going to make journeys that span several years, we\'ll need to find a way to reuse and recycle everything they bring with them,\" Mark A. Blenner, Ph.D., says. \"Atom economy will become really important.\"\n\nThe solution lies in part with the astronauts themselves, who will constantly generate waste from breathing, eating and using materials. Unlike their friends on Earth, Blenner says, these spacefarers won\'t want to throw any waste molecules away. So he and his team are studying how to repurpose these molecules and convert them into products the astronauts need, such as polyesters and nutrients.\n\nSome essential nutrients, such as omega-3 fatty acids, have a shelf life of just a couple of years, says Blenner, who is at Clemson University. They\'ll need to be made en route, beginning a few years after launch, or at the destination. \"Having a biological system that astronauts can awaken from a dormant state to start producing what they need, when they need it, is the motivation for our project,\" he says.\n\nBlenner\'s biological system includes a variety of strains of the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. These organisms require both nitrogen and carbon to grow. Blenner\'s team discovered that the yeast can obtain their nitrogen from urea in untreated urine. Meanwhile, the yeast obtain their carbon from CO2, which could come from astronauts\' exhaled breath, or from the Martian atmosphere. But to use CO2, the yeast require a middleman to \"fix\" the carbon into a form they can ingest. For this purpose, the yeast rely on photosynthetic cyanobacteria or algae provided by the researchers.\n\nOne of the yeast strains produces omega-3 fatty acids, which contribute to heart, eye and brain health. Another strain has been engineered to churn out monomers and link them to make polyester polymers. Those polymers could then be used in a 3-D printer to generate new plastic parts. Blenner\'s team is continuing to engineer this yeast strain to produce a variety of monomers that can be polymerized into different types of polyesters with a range of properties.\n\nFor now, the engineered yeast strains can produce only small amounts of polyesters or nutrients, but the scientists are working on boosting output. They\'re also looking into applications here on Earth, in fish farming and human nutrition. For example, fish raised via aquaculture need to be given omega-3 fatty acid supplements, which could be produced by Blenner\'s yeast strains.\n\nAlthough other research groups are also putting yeast to work, they aren\'t taking the same approach. For example, a team from DuPont is already using yeast to make omega-3 fatty acids for aquaculture, but its yeast feed on refined sugar instead of waste products, Blenner says. Meanwhile, two other teams are engineering yeast to make polyesters. However, unlike Blenner\'s group, they aren\'t engineering the organisms to optimize the type of polyester produced, he says.\n\nWhatever their approach, these researchers are all adding to the body of knowledge about Y. lipolytica, which has been studied much less than, say, the yeast used in beer production. \"We\'re learning that Y. lipolytica is quite a bit different than other yeast in their genetics and biochemical nature,\" Blenner says. \"Every new organism has some amount of quirkiness that you have to focus on and understand better.\"',20,NULL,0,'2017-08-27 22:22:41'),(10,'http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4827206/Man-arrested-murder-young-boy.html','Man arrested over murder murder of a young boy in Manchester','Police were called to a report of a domestic incident in Wythenshawe, Manchester, shortly after midnight on Sunday and discovered the body of the toddler when they entered the property.',NULL,NULL,NULL,0,'2017-08-27 22:22:41');
